# 🛡️ Fraud Detection System

Fraud Detection System is a machine learning-based project designed to identify fraudulent financial transactions. It uses real-world datasets and applies algorithms like XGBoost to detect suspicious patterns in transactional behavior.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 ML model training using real-world fraud datasets
- 📊 High class imbalance handling using XGBoost
- 🧪 Real-time fraud prediction simulation
- 🌍 Kaggle-hosted datasets for large-scale training
- 🖥️ Planned UI for payment simulation and alerting

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Flask / Streamlit (planned for UI)
- Jupyter Notebooks (for EDA and prototyping)

---

## 🧾 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `xgboost`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `flask` or `streamlit`
